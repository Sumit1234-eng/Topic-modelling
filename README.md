# Topic-modelling

Topic modelling is recognizing the words from the topics present in the 
document or the corpus of data. This is useful because extracting the words 
from a document takes more time and is much more complex than extracting 
them from topics present in the document.

# AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project was to identify the relationships between the entities 
across the given json files which contain the news articles in it and come up 
with a solution to provide the named entity recognition.

# TASK TO DO
extract the text from the files

Data pre-processing - Removing stopwords and punctuation marks.

Data pre-processing – Lemmatization

Data Pre-Processing – Tokenization

Model Building –
We can use Various models now to accomplish our required task.
Eg: Topic modelling is done using LDA(Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation). Topic modelling refers to the task of identifying topics that 
best describes a set of documents. These topics will only emerge during 
the topic modelling process (therefore called latent). And one popular 
topic modelling technique is known as Latent Dirichlet Allocation 
(LDA).
